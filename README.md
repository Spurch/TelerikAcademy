# TelerikAcademy
My Telerik Academy repository.
This repository is meant for all homework, examples, etc. code related to Telerik Software Academy
season 2015/2016. 
All submitted work will be in .zip archive format. This refers mostly to:
  - Whole/Completed Telerik Academy homework assignments.
  - Specific examples of some functionality.
  - Solved exam problems from past Academy seasons.
Exceptions will be made for single source file examples and so on.
All uploaded .zip archives are clean - a.k.a no Debug, Bin, Obj etc. unnecessary luggage.
All Solutions are created and tested on MS Windows 7 Ultimate edition & MS Visual Studio 2013 Prof. edition.
